        <section name="Mod4j Professional Support">
            <p> Mod4j is open source and therefore free to use for anyone. On the Mod4j website you
                will find extensive documentation free of charge. </p>
            <p> When applying Mod4j or model-driven software development in general it is often good
                to get some experts for training and consulting. The companies below all have Mod4j
                committers aboard and offer some form of support around Mod4j. </p>

                of all of the Eclipse Modeling tools that are usded in the development of the DSLs.
                Ordina can provide you with the services described below. If you are interested in
                professional support from Ordina please contact <a

            <subsection name="Using Mod4j">
                <p> Ordina provides professional training and consultancy to support you in
                    kick-starting the use of Mod4j. Additionally we can deliver experienced
                    architects and developers with Mod4j skills. They can speed up development
                    and also act as a Mod4j mentor to the rest of the team. Having an experienced

            <subsection name="Adapting Mod4j">
                <p> The Mod4j DSL provide a usefull starting point, but will not always be exactly
                    what you need. The structure of Mod4j is made with flexibility in mind. It is
                    therefore possible to change or extend the DSLs in various ways. Our
                    experienced Mod4j development team can help you to analyse the applicability of
                    Mod4j, find the changes you need and incorporate them into Mod4j. </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Developing Custom DSL">
                <p> If you need custom DSLs for your development you will need some high level DSL
                    development skills. With our experience of building DSLs like Mod4j we can help
                    you setup your own DSL. If required, Ordina can also connect your own DSL to the
                    existing Mod4j DSLs to enhance the possibilities. </p>
