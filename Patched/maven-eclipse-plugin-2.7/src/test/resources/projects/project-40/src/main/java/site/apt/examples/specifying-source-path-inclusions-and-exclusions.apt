Overview

	With the change done as part of {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MECLIPSE-443}MECLIPSE-443 "Only include **/*.java in Java source directories"}} 
	the .classpath entries for classpathentry kind="src" now specify an <<<including>>> attribute with a value of <<<"**/*.java">>>.
	Previously this attribute was not specified	which meant that eclipse would include any file in this src directory as being on the classpath and hence compiled.
	
	This broke Ajdt support as <<<"**/*.aj">>> files were no longer included on the classpath and {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MECLIPSE-538}MECLIPSE-538}} fixed this.
	
	{{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MECLIPSE-104}MECLIPSE-104 "Add the ability to specify source inclusions/exclusions"}} was added put back this flexibility.
	
	In summary:
	
	  * If your project is a java project then "**/*.java" will always be added to the including attribute of source directories.
	  
	  * If your project is an ajdt project then "**/*.aj" will always be added to the including attribute of source directories.
	  
	  * If you need any additional includes or excludes for source directories then use the configuration elements sourceIncludes/sourceExcludes

Example - Specifying sourceIncludes/sourceExcludes

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <sourceExcludes>
            <sourceExclude>**/.svn/**</sourceExclude>
          </sourceExcludes>
          <sourceIncludes>
            <sourceInclude>**/*.myExtension</sourceInclude>
          </sourceIncludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>

	This will result in the <<<.classpath>>> file having source directory entries similar to this:
	
+-----
  <classpathentry kind="src" path="src/main/java" including="**/*.myExtension|**/*.java" excluding="**/.svn/**"/>
