                        - Set the
                        <b>Text file encoding</b>
                        in Eclipse to
                        <b>UTF-8</b>
                        . For Linux users UTF-8 is usually the default
                        platform encoding, and no change will be necessary.
                        <br />
                        - Enable the option
                        <b>Refresh automatically</b>
                        . While working with the Mod4j editors a lot of the
                        (re)sources will be generated or regenerated. To
                        keep
                        the compiler happy its convenient to refresh your
                        workspace automatically.
                        <br />

                <p>
                    You can create the following Mod4j models in your project:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <img src="../../images/mod4j-business.ico" align="left" alt="" />

                <p>
                    Before you start we want to bring our
                    <b>RecordShop</b>
                    example project to your
                    attention. This project contains a example of each of the Mod4j models above. So
                    if
                    you want to learn the syntax and structure of the models, take a look at the
                    RecordShop. The RecorodShop is
                    an example project that we maintain during our
                    development process. Features we implement in Mod4j are first
                    tested in the
                    RecordShop.

                    <li>
                        First of all you need to create a new Eclipse project for the Mod4j DSL
                        models you are going to create.
                        <br />

                            File, New, Other, Mod4j,

                        Enter the application name of the project. For instance:

                        Uncheck the "Use default location" checkbox and choose a location where all
                        model projects and modules
                        for your application can be placed.
                        <br />
                        While
                        your project develops over time, this folder will contain the project
                        modules you create: all
                        generated project modules and the generated Maven
                        parent-pom.
                        <br />
                        We suggest (commonly used) you use the following folder
                        structure:
                        <br />
                        <code>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After finishing the wizard, a new project is created with the name
                        <b>MyApplication-dslModels</b>
                        and a directory structure like this:

                        <code>

                        with the
                        <code>BusinessDomain Model Editor</code>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>Here you can add the classes, attributes, businessrules, associations etc.
                        of your BusinessDomain model.

                        lot to find the right keywords and model elements to use.

            <subsection name="Generating source code">
                <p> If you've completed and saved your model(s) as described in the previous
                    section, the source code and
                    resources for your application are automatically
                    generated out of the model(s). Here below is described were
                    you can find them
                    and how to import them as projects into Eclipse. You can also find a overview
                    and the
                    location of the generated sources by opening the Mod4j "Generated Files"
                    console. (Window > Show View > Other
                    > Mod4j > Generated Files). </p>

                    <li>
                        As you can see in the figure above, the Business Domain model generates
                        (re)sources into two modules: the
                        -data and -domain module. If these modules
                        don't exist the modules will be automatically created. The
                        <b>-domain</b>
                        and
                        <b>-data</b>
                        modules are created in the application folder for all your
                        modules, right beside the
                        <code>MyApplication.dslModels</code>
                        folder. See:
                        <code>../MyApplication-domain</code>
                        and
                        <code>../MyApplication-data</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The generated sources and resources are placed in the
                        <code>generated-sources</code>
                        and
                        <code>generated-resources</code>
                        folders. Sources in
                        <code>MyApplication-domain/generated-sources</code>
                        and
                        resources in
                        <code>MyApplication-data/generated-resources</code>
                        <br />
                        All Extension Points (see also next section) are initially generated
                        into the
                        <code>src/main/..</code>
                        folders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the generated modules are fully Mavenized you can import the
                        generated modules as Maven projects
                        into Eclipse. But before ypu do that,
                        it's a good practice to check if the generated modules can be build
                        by
                        Maven.
                        <br />
                        Open a command console and navigate to location of the
                        generated parent-pom (it's the pom.xml in the root
                        of your application
                        folder).
                        <br />
                        type:
                        <code>
                            <b>mvn clean install</b>
                        </code>
                        <br />
                        If you run Maven for the first time, it could take a few minutes to
                        complete for downloading the needed
                        dependencies. After the build is
                        finished and you've seen "BUILD SUCCESFULL", the parent-pom and
                        submodules
                        are locally installed and you can import the modules as Maven projects into
                        Eclipse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can import all the generated Maven modules at once as follows:
                        <br />
                        Choose: Import, Maven 2,
                        <b>Maven 2 Project</b>
                        <br />
                        and navigate to the application folder. Choose
                        <b>Ok</b>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By default all modules found with a pom are selected for the import. Make
                        sure you do not import the the
                        <b>MyApplication-dslModels</b>
                        module by
                        deselecting it. This module already exist as project in your Eclipse
                        workspace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complete the import by clicking on
                        <b>Finish</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the previous step the IAM Maven plug-in not always recognizes the source folders correctly. If you
                        encounter compilation failures, adjust the source folders manually. Right-click on the project to adjust
                        the "Build Path" configuration. Add
                        <code>src/main/java, src/test/java, src/main/resources, generated-sources</code>
                        and
                        <code>generated-resources</code>
                        to it.
                    </li>

            <subsection name="Extension Points">
                <p> There are several reasons to mention why a developer needs to manually add
                    (re)sources to the generated
                    (re)sources by Mod4j. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To implement business rules</li>
                    <li>If the generated code does not fit the developers needs, and changing the
                        model is not possible or does
                        not lead to the right result. </li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <p> For these reasons with Mod4j you can use Extension Points. Extension Points are
                    extends to the generated
                    (re)sources and provide a place where developers
                    manually can make additions to- or change the behavior of
                    the system. Initially
                    Mod4j generates Extension Points once if they do not exist already. So Extension
                    Points
                    will not be overwritten by the generator. </p>
                <p>
                    Typically Extension Points are placed under the
                    <code>src</code>
                    folder of a
                    module and needs to be added to the projects versioncontrol system.
